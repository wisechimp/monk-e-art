Monk-E is an AI artist (Aitist?) used as a front for OpenAI's DALL-E .

The site was built with create-react-app and coded with Typescript. You can visit it [here](https://salvator-monke.netlify.app/).

If you'd like to have you own monkey artist then you should be able to [sign up](https://openai.com/blog/dall-e-now-available-without-waitlist) and get credits to try it out for yourself. Good luck generating something that won't give you nightmares like some of Monk-E's initial attempts at a self portrait!
