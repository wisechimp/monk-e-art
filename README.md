UPDATE 25/10/23 - Monk-E has run out of credit with OpenAI and so the poor fellow is unable to do any work. Feel free to offer paid employment to his creator to enable him to start up again...!

Monk-E is an AI artist (Aitist?) used as a front for OpenAI's DALL-E .

The site was built with create-react-app and coded with Typescript. You can visit it [here](https://salvator-monke.netlify.app/) (but see above!).

If you'd like to have you own monkey artist then you should be able to [sign up](https://openai.com/blog/dall-e-now-available-without-waitlist) and get credits to try it out for yourself. Good luck generating something that won't give you nightmares like some of Monk-E's initial attempts at a self portrait!
